# free-hosting-sites
A collection of hosting sites that is quite useful when I was just a beginner. Really useful to know when I was undergoing my undergraduate studies.


## List of What I Have Personally Used

- [000webhost](https://www.000webhost.com) is a zero cost website hosting with PHP, MySQL, cPanel. This was used during my first time  hosting a web app I developed when I was an undergraduate student. It's good for beginners as I picked it up quite fast. There are many tutorials and discussions online for me to refer whenever I encountered problems or any confusion.

- The second one that I have tried is [InfinityFree](https://infinityfree.net). As a student, you just want to see what you have created to go online on a server/hosting. It was easy to adapt to and I did not have too much trouble with it. After 000webhost limit was exceeded, I searched for the next best thing and settled with this one.

- GitHub pages is also a gem. I use it for my personal portfolio to showcase my development projects. Many resources and tutorials are available, and the tutorials on Youtube are the easiest to understand in my opinion. I succeeded in getting the GitHub Student Pack and therefore I got my first ever .me domain free for a year from NameCheap.


## Note
These are what I found and remembered how I immediately dived head first into this unknown territory. These are interesting finds and I noted them here, if I ever forget how to find them.
